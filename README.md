# InstagramReachAnalysis

Instagram is one of the most popular social media applications today. People using Instagram professionally are using it for promoting their business, building a portfolio, blogging, and creating various kinds of content. As Instagram is a popular application used by millions of people with different niches, Instagram keeps changing to make itself better for the content creators and the users. But as this keeps changing, it affects the reach of our posts that affects us in the long run. So if a content creator wants to do well on Instagram in the long run, they have to look at the data of their Instagram reach. That is where the use of Data Science in social media comes in.If you want to analyze the reach of your Instagram account, you have to collect your data manually as there are some APIs, but they don’t work well. So it’s better to collect your Instagram data manually.

As im still a newbie in data science field I ollowed this awesome step by step article on Instagram Reach Analysis: https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2022/03/22/instagram-reach-analysis-using-python/

first,we start the task of analyzing the reach of my Instagram account by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset. Dataset is available here: https://statso.io/instagram-reach-analysis-case-study/

Features of the data to be analyzed:
Impressions: Number of impressions in a post (Reach)
From Home: Reach from home
From Hashtags: Reach from Hashtags
From Explore: Reach from Explore
From Other: Reach from other sources
Saves: Number of saves
Comments: Number of comments
Shares: Number of shares
Likes: Number of Likes
Profile Visits: Numer of profile visits from the post
Follows: Number of Follows from the post
Caption: Caption of the post
Hashtags: Hashtags used in the post

I tried to find some enticing answers from this data:
1.Analyzing Instagram Reach
2.Analyzing Content
3.Analyzing Relationships
4.Analyzing Conversion Rate

After analyzing this data, I trained a machine learning model to predict the reach of an Instagram post. Let’s split the data into training and test sets before training the model,then predict the reach of an Instagram post by giving inputs to the machine learning model.

SUMMARY:
So this is how you can analyze and predict the reach of Instagram posts with machine learning using Python. If a content creator wants to do well on Instagram in a long run, they have to look at the data of their Instagram reach. That is where the use of Data Science in social media comes in.
